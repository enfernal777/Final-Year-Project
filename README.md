# SENDA: Forecasting Sectoral Energy Usage and Demand Using AI Techniques (SENDA)

## Introduction
SENDA ("pathway" in Spanish) represents a strategic direction in energy demand forecasting. This project is driven by a deep commitment to contributing to Malaysia's sustainable development goals, addressing critical challenges such as population growth, industrial expansion, and climate change. By employing cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, SENDA aims to predict energy consumption across multiple sectors, empowering Malaysia to optimize energy management and ensure a sustainable future.
---

## Project Objectives
- **Develop multiple AI models**: Implement six forecasting models , Random Forest, Linear Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG), ARIMA, VAR, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
- **Sectoral Focus**: Apply these models to five key sectors, resulting in a total of 30 predictive models.
- **Sustainability alignment**: Optimize energy usage and management, contributing to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).

---

## Features
- **Sector-Specific Forecasting**: Models tailored to industrial, agricultural, residential, transport, and commercial sectors.
- **Comprehensive Modeling**: Evaluate and compare 30 different models for robust insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Tableau for presenting results in an accessible and actionable format.
