 	Energy Demand Forecasting: Combining Cointegration Analysis
 and Artificial Intelligence Algorithm
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization
- Used of econometric technique 
+ incdicate the population growth, economic growth and urbanization
+ would be valuable to policy makers

	Electricity Demand Forecasting with Use of Artificial
 Intelligence: The Case of Gokceada Island
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi Linear Regression



-- Model / algo will be choose later so no worry yet
-- All of them use MAE, MSE, MAPE and RMSE why?
-- Why it got value for policy makers?
